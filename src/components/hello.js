            I'm a software engineer with several years experience in both
            frontend and backend development. I focus on multiple javascript
            frameworks and the Java ecosystem. I also really enjoy functional
            languages such as Haskell and Elm.

          <p className="is-size-5 my-2">
            I think software engineering is really special. It empowers us to
            create entirety new things, share knowledge in completely new ways,
            and make our visions explicit.
          </p>
          <p className="is-size-5 my-2">
            For the past few years, I've always worked in a team. A
            well-functioning team is a beautiful thing. I especially enjoy
            learning from my colleagues and sharing with them my capabilities
            and discoveries.
