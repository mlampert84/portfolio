  "Above all else, I'm a practical software engineer. I see software as a tool for solving real-world problems.",
  "I really enjoy the creative experience of making new things in the orderly, logically manner that good software demands.",
  "I try to cultivate a breath of experience.  I've worked both in the public and the private sector, in large teams and small teams, and throughout the entire tech stack.",
  "I prefer strongly typed languages and functional programming.",
  "Despite one's preference for a language or style of programming, the guiding principle in software development should be: the right tool for the job.",
  "There are often many different ways in software engineering to achieve the same objective.  Working well with other developers is often about knowing when something is in fact gained by Path A or Path B, and communicating that viewpoint.  Often it makes no difference, and, in that case, defer to your colleagues."
